# Project-2-Multiagent-in-Pacman
In this project, you will design agents for the classic version of Pacman, including ghosts. Along the way, you will implement both minimax and expectimax search and try your hand at evaluation function design.
The code base has not changed much from the previous project, but please start with a fresh installation, rather than intermingling files from project 1.
As in project 1, this project includes an autograder for you to grade your answers on your machine. This can be run on all questions with the command:
`python autograder.py`.

It can be run for one particular question, such as q2, by:
`python autograder.py -q q2`.

It can be run for one particular test by commands of the form:
`python autograder.py -t test_cases/q2/0-small-tree`.

By default, the autograder displays graphics with the `-t` option, but doesn’t with the `-q` option. You can force graphics by using the `-- graphics` flag, or force no graphics by using the `--no-graphics` flag.
See the autograder tutorial in Project 0 for more information about using the autograder.
The code for this project contains the following files, available as a zip archive on Canvas.

| Files you'll edit:       |                             |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `multiAgents.py`         | Where all of your multi-agent search agents will reside. |

| Files you might want to look at: |                             |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `pacman.py`                      | The main file that runs Pacman games. This file also describes a Pacman GameState type, which you will use extensively in this project. |
| `game.py`                        | The logic behind how the Pacman world works. This file describes several supporting types like AgentState, Agent, Direction, and Grid. |
| `util.py`                        | Useful data structures for implementing search algorithms. You don't need to use these for this project, but may find other functions defined here to be useful. |

| Supporting files you can ignore: |                             |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `graphicsDisplay.py`             | Graphics for Pacman         |
| `graphicsUtils.py`               | Support for Pacman graphics |
| `textDisplay.py`                 | ASCII graphics for Pacman   |
| `ghostAgents.py`                 | Agents to control ghosts    |
| `keyboardAgents.py`              | Keyboard interfaces to control Pacman |
| `layout.py`                      | Code for reading layout files and storing their contents |
| `autograder.py`                  | Project autograder          |
| `testParser.py`                  | Parses autograder test and solution files |
| `testClasses.py`                 | General autograding test classes |
| `test_cases/`                    | Directory containing the test cases for each question |
| `multiagentTestClasses.py`       | Project 3 specific autograding test classes |

**Files to Edit and Submit:** You will fill in portions of multiAgents.py during the assignment. Once you have completed the assignment, you will submit these files to Gradescope (for instance, you can upload all .py files in the folder). Please do not change the other files in
this distribution.

**Evaluation:** Your code will be autograded for technical correctness. Please do not change the names of any provided functions or classes within the code, or you will wreak havoc on the autograder. However, the correctness of your implementation – not the autograder’s
judgements – will be the final judge of your score. If necessary, we will review and grade assignments individually to ensure that you receive due credit for your work.
